Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `PokemonDataset` class: This class will be responsible for loading and manipulating the Pokemon dataset.
   - `load_dataset()` method: Loads the Pokemon dataset from a file.
   - `filter_by_type(type: str)` method: Filters the dataset to include only Pokemon of a specific type.
   - `multiply_stat_by_type(stat: str, multiplier: int)` method: Multiplies a specific stat by a multiplier for Pokemon of a specific type.

2. `PerformanceComparator` class: This class will be responsible for comparing the performance of calculations using polars and pandas.
   - `compare_performance()` method: Performs the calculations using both polars and pandas and measures the execution time.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.

1. `pokemon_dataset.py`:
